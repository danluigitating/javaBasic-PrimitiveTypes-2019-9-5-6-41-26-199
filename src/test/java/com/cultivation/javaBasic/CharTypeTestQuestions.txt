What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
It is defined in the Java documentation.
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/characters.html

Why the test failed at first?
The test failed becuse the values are set to an empty string.

Why you corrected the test that way?
I have to fill-up the variables with the right escape characters.

Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
None
