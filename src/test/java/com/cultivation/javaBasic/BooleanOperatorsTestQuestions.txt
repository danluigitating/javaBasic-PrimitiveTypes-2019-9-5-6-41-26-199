What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
Bitwise operators are used to perform manipulation of individual bits of a number. They can be used with any of the integral types (char, short, int, etc).

Why the test failed at first?
The test failed because the array for comparing results is empty.

Why you corrected the test that way?
I corrected the test by manually inputting the expected value when doing the operations.

Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
None
