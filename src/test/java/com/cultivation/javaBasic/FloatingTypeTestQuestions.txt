What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html

Why the test failed at first?
Some of the test cases failed because the value for comparison is not defined or the method for checking is not defined. 

Why you corrected the test that way?
I corrected the test cases by manually filling up the expected results and completing the missing methods.

Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
None
